# API-Project

### My 2nd Internship Project.

#### Tasks:
- Install [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Integrate API with database from my 1st Project (which is fetch data from [VirusTotal API](https://developers.virustotal.com/v3.0/reference) and insert the data into [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database)
- Include logic function to check if the result is on database or not, if it's not in the database, retrieve it from VirusTotal and insert it into database

#### Steps taken through this project:
- Did some reading on FastAPI document and also the document on [SQL (Relational) Database](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/sql-databases/) where we can use any relational database that you want and adapt it to your database using SQLAlchemy
- Did my codes with the reference of the documents mentioned above and with the help of my previous internship project's codes, I was able to complete the logic functions required
