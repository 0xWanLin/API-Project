### Implementation of Django on my website and the usage of Django Admin Page
- Created an search page after applying Django with FastAPI
- Designed and Customized Django Admin Page (to suit users)

#### Things to take note:
- newsite folder = project root folder
- scans folder = app name folder
- static/css folder = where all the CSS files are
- templates folder = where all the HTML files are
- running Django server on port 8080
- running FastAPI (uvicorn) on port 8000
